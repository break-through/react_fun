Figuring out react, these are prop-less and state-less files, will upload those at a later time
This file basically showcases a few things - one, how React can be used to create "tiles", each of which can act as it's own "app". This means that every tile has the potential to do almost anything through javascript. All these tiles will be centered within the main tile, so if needed, we can have tile-ception to any degree. Each tile within this tile-ception has the potential to be an entire app with full on javascript ability. Webpack and Babel make it easier to code, and CSS in-line styles (of which the syntax is very different) can be a nice edition (although I don't think I used it as well as I could have). JSX itself is a very nice system.
Once installing these files, make sure to have node_modules in the same directory as the rest of the files. At the very least, node_modules should be on your computer and referenced.
